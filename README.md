### This project is for my fullstackopen submission

- Before running project, **run db.json** with `yarn server`. That will run a local server on `port 3001`. 
- You can check local server situation with `http://localhost:3001/persons`
- Every project is in its corresponding folder. If you want to render/see a specific project  change ***src/index.js*** with ***\_index.js*** in the corresponding folder.
